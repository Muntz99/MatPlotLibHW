Pymaceuticals Evaluations

1. In reviewing the data for Pymaceuticals the first thing I did was verify that we had a similar number of mice being reviewed for each Drug Regimen. This can be seen in reviewing the bar chart in the Charts folder. The data showed that 24-25 mice were used for each drug to ensure uniform results.

2. Next I wanted to determine if there was a clear Correlation between the weight of the mouse and the size of the tumor. In first casting a scatter plot it would show that the weight of the mouse seemed to increase exponentially in relation to the size of the tumor. I computed the Pearson Correlation and got a result of 0.84 indicating a strong correlation between the two factors and using linear regression was able to plot a clear line confirming the correlation between weight and tumor size.

3. Lastly, I wanted to chart the results of a specific mouse that was treat Capomulin. In review the results showed that Capomulin was very effective in shrinking the size of the Tumor consistently the longer the mouse was treated. There were brief moments of increased tumor growth immediately followed by a sharp reduction in size.
